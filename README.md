  ## Contributing
  Currently this is a solo project but any further contribution on more ideal ways of formatting or adding in more licenses to the generator would be helpful for future considerations of changes.

  ## Tests
  Follow the prompts and if you get a README.md in the same directory as the index.js file you setup and used this program correctly!
